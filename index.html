<h1> DappHub </h1>

<intro>
<p> We believe that the free software movement is the most important cultural predecessor to the modern-day renaissance in decentralized technologies.</p>

<p> To catalyze the growth of this nascent ecosystem, and to empower hackers all over the world to participate, we’re building a comprehensive suite of blockchain-oriented <a href=https://dapp.tools>developer tools</a> in the spirit of the Unix Philosophy.</p>

<p> Powerful things happen when like-minded people connect.
We build infrastructure for the next generation of the internet.</p>
